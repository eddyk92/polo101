			<h2 class="object text-center title2">Object of the Game</h2>
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<h3>A Sport of Kings</h3>
				<p>The object of Polo is for a team to score more points than its opposition, thus winning the game. Each team attempts to move the ball into the opposition's half of the pitch with the aim of eventually hitting it through the goal to score. Each team of four is made up of attackers and defenders, but realistically all members of a polo team are expected to be flexible and make any play whether offensive or defensive and change position as necessary to benefit the team.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="row col-md-12">
				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h3>Scoring</h3>
					<p>Scoring is simple in Polo, and a point (known as a goal) is scored when the ball is hit into the goal. Unlike many other games that change halves at set periods such as halftime, in Polo, teams change field direction every time a goal is scored. It’s not known exactly why this is the case but it is thought that it stems from the past where pitches were traditionally on an East/West axis and teams would not want to spend extended periods of time with the sun or wind in their face. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h3>Players</h3>
					<p>Each team is made up of four players, each one assigned a position which is displayed by the number worn on their kit. Postion 1 is known as an attacking offensive player. Position 2 is an offensive player primarily backing up the position 1 player in attack. Position 3 is very similar to a quaterback and is filled with the best player on the team who can hit the ball upfield to positions 1 and 2. Position four is a defensive position, tasked with defending the team's goal.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h3>Polo Ponies</h3>
					<p>The mounts used are called 'polo ponies', although the term pony is purely traditional and the mount is actually a full-size horse. The polo pony is selected carefully for quick bursts of speed, stamina, agility and manoeuvrability. Temperament is critical; the horse must remain responsive under pressure and not become excited or difficult to control. Many are Thoroughbreds or Thoroughbred crosses. A well trained horse will carry its rider smoothly and swiftly to the ball and can account for 60 to 75 percent of the player's skill and net worth to his team. </p>
